Lets have a discussion on what is the best way to sell you Agency or Agencies.

                            When someone buys your agency, they’re typically buying the agency’s future stream of profits. Higher profits and an in-demand agency = higher selling price. Lower profits and a run-of-the-mill agency = lower selling price.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-4">
                            The usual formula is for acquirers to pay a “multiple” of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Ask your accountant about your EBITDA— this might be the bottom line on your Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement, but it may
                            not—it depends on how your accountant set up your P&L, and how you’re paying yourself.

                        <p>
                            It’s all negotiable—but a 3-7X multiple is typical for agencies. The multiple assumes a 3-year average of EBITDA, after adjusting to ensure EBITDA reflects market-rate compensation to the owner(s). Keep in mind that to get your ideal multiple, you need
                            to get in front of the right acquirer. For more on that, there is a lot of pre planning and it is bets to approach us before you go off on a tangent .

                            How to get a healthy price when you sell
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            With that “multiple of EBITDA” valuation approach in mind, any of these combinations could produce a million-dollar sale price for your agency:
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-4">
                            If you look, you’ll see agencies are frequently listed at a 3X multiple. If your annual net profits are $100,000, a 3X multiple means you’d sell for $300,000. Getting your annual net profits to $150,000 means you’d sell for $450,000—an extra $150K.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, having the right financials is no guarantee that someone will pay that amount. If you use us at Agencys—which you probably should , unless a qualified buyer approaches you out of the blue with a reasonable offer—you’ll also need to allow for
